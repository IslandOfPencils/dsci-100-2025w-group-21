    "\n",
    "<h4 style=\"font-size: x-medium;\">Introduction to our question:</h4>\n",
    "For this project, our group chose to investigate question 3 on demand forcasting, namely - \"what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players\", to ensure the server has a sufficient number of licences in order to keep up with concurrent players. Reflecting the courses philosphy of transform -> visualize -> model -> repeat, and our focus on modeling over the last few weeks, we were specifically interested in whether we could use the preexisting server data to predict what times may have the most players, and the probably upper bounds of player activity we could reasonably predict, in order to advise the server team if they need to increase their server capacity.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4 style=\"font-size: x-medium;\">The data:</h4>\n",
    "In order to begin our investigation, we were given 2 dataframes, one on player information and one on play sessions information, both of which we deemed important for us to answer our question:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sessions dataframe includes 1606 rows, with each corresponding to a single play session, and 5 columns, titled:\n",
    "- start_time - The time and date that a player logged onto the server and began to play, as a string in a DD/MM/YYYY format for data and a 24 hour time.\n",
    "- end_time - The time and date that a player logged off the server after stopping playing or being kicked off, as a string in a DD/MM/YYYY format for data and a 24 hour time.\n",
    "- original_start_time - The same information as start_time but measured in unix time, as a float which measures from Jan 1st, 1970 (Wikipedia)\n",
    "- original_end_time - The same information as end_time but as a float measured in unix time \n",
    "- hashedEmail - A string identifier that attributed each play session to a specific individual\n",
    "\n",
    "This granular data on the dates of player logins and their session start/end times is useful to our investivation as it allowed us to analyze overlap between their playtimes and find trends in playtime.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The players dataframe includes information on each player, having 196 rows which corresponded to a player each, and 7 columns, titled:\n",
    "- experience - A metric of self-reported experience within the game, an ordinal with categories 'amateur', 'beginner', 'regular', 'pro', and 'veteran'\n",
    "- subscribe - Whether the player has or has not subscribed to the servers game-related newsletter\n",
    "- hashedEmail - A string identifier that attributed each play session to a specific individual, this is the same 'hashedEmail' as in the sessions dataset, which allowed for merging both on this variable\n",
    "- played_hours - The number of hours each player cumulatively put into playing on the minecraft server, reported by the player and saved as a float (being a number with a decimal)\n",
    "- name - The player's name, reported by the player, saved as a string\n",
    "- age - The player's age, reported by the player, saved as an integer value\n",
    "- individualID - NAN values\n",
    "- organizationname - NAN values\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is useful as it enabled us to attribute our findings about playtime/play sessions to specific individuals, and can help in investigating further into trends in play sessions.\n",
    "<h4 style=\"font-size: x-medium;\">Issues:</h4>\n",
    "In our cross-analysis of dataframes, we came across 3 main issues we thought were valuable to mention:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  First, we noticed that there were hashedEmails not attributed to any playtimes, which means that there are some players who registered who have never played, and therefore are not tracked in the sessions frame. \n",
    "2.  The second issue we noticed was in the self-reporting process of personal information. While logistically impossible to do otherwise, self reporting can lead to people lying or putting false information, meaning that our information about played hours or experience could be faulty, and even throw our analysis entirely off.\n",
    "3. The final issue is the relative measure of experience, relying on the individuals own interpretation of what a beginner/amatuer/veteran/pro is.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues didn't end up influencing our results heavily, however, as our question centered around play sessions, not necessarily the players behind them, which means we could drop any player information that was attributed to people who never logged into the server, and could ignore most of the self-reported information that was possibly faulty."
